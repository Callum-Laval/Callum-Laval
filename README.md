Hi 👋 My name is Callum Laval
=============================

I am a MSci mathematics graduate with a first class degree from Lancaster University. Using analytical and research skills, I am able to complete goals and projects to a very high standard, on time, both independently and as part of a team. I have developed presentation and communication skills, with the ability to explain complex and highly technical topics to people at any level. I am currently improving my data and programming skills in an 8-week intensive digital skills bootcamp. I have developed programming skills in Python and R and have Learned data visualisation skills in Excel, Tableau and PowerBI. My goal is become established in a data analyst role since it is an area where I can develop my analysis skills and collaborate in a team environment. I believe that with my problem-solving skills and my attention to detail I can interpret complex data sets and prepare reports to communicate trends in data.

* 🌍  I'm based in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, UK.
